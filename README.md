Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

I'm Wojciech Kiełbowicz, and this profile is a curated space where I showcase my projects, analytical thinking, and evolution as a Data Scientist.

About This Repository:

The main goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate my technical skills and practical approach to solving real-world problems through data. You'll find a variety of projects covering:

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-Machine Learning Models

-Statistical Analysis

-Data Visualization

Let’s Connect & Grow Together:

I believe that the best way to master Data Science is through collaboration and continuous learning.

If you venture into my code, I highly encourage you to leave comments or suggestions. Whether it’s a tip on optimizing an algorithm, a different perspective on data interpretation, or a simple "hello" – I truly value feedback from those who have a deeper understanding of the field.

"Knowledge grows when shared." I’m always happy to supplement my skills with new insights from the community.
